## Call for Papers

Analogical abstraction is a fundamental cognitive skill unique to humans (Penn et al., 2008; Hofstadter, 2001), defined as the ability to perceive and utilize the similarities between concepts, situations or events based on (systems of) relations rather than surface similarities (Holyoak, 2012; Gentner et al., 2012). Analogy enables creative inferences, explanations, and generalization of knowledge, and has been used for scientific inventions (Dunbar and Klahr, 2012), solving problems (Gick and Holyoak, 1980), and policy-making (Houghton, 1998). As such, it has been the goal of one of the first AI programs developed by Evans (1964). It has also been the subject of cognitive theories and studies about humans for common processes, such as the retrieval of memories (Wharton et al., 1994) and problem-solving (Gick and Holyoak, 1980), mostly leveraging narratives as their experimental medium (Gentner and Toupin, 1986; Gentner et al., 1993; Wharton et al., 1994), given their multi-tiered nature and potential for abstraction. 

Meanwhile, analogical tasks have also been a relatively popular topic in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), typically framed as intelligence tests for models compared against humans. So-called word-based, proportional analogies of the form (A : B :: C : D) (Mikolov et al., 2013a,b; Gladkova et al., 2016; Ushio et al., 2021) are often used to measure the potential of word embeddings and language models. Recent studies (Webb et al., 2023) show a strong ability of state-of the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs) to discover proportional word analogies, though this skill degrades with higher complexity (Wijesiriwardene et al., 2023) or when controlling for association-based answers (Stevenson et al., 2023). Shifting toward more complex settings, narrative-based analogy benchmarks that involve system mappings rather than simple word-based relational mappings have been also been considered recently, with limitations in scope, generalizability, and alignment with cognitive theories (Nagarajah et al., 2022; Wijesiriwardene et al., 2023; Sourati et al., 2023). Meanwhile, given the potential of large language and visual models, another line of research aims to study their ability to draw analogies consistently (cf., Webb et al., 2023). Given the richness of analogical abstraction and the wide interest in this topic from artificial intelligence, linguistics, and cognitive psychology, it is important to connect these communities and facilitate cross-disciplinary activities.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers with an interest in analogical abstraction from natural language processing, cognitive psychology, computer vision, deep learning, and neuro-symbolic AI. Such a workshop will enable a common ground where the complementary perspectives from these fields can come together to form a comprehensive picture of the current landscape of analogical abstraction, and point to standing challenges, evaluation methodologies, and emerging techniques of interest. Thus, we find it essential to hold this workshop at a venue like IJCAI where leading researchers from the focal areas are gathered. The multidisciplinary nature of the workshop is emphasized by the broad set of skills of the organization team and the program committee, and the diversity principle guiding the list of topics and the invited keynotes.

### Relevant topics and contributions

We invite contributions ranging from cognitive modeling and algorithms and methods to new tasks and new applications of analogy. Contributions that take an interdisciplinary perspective are particularly encouraged. We welcome novel short, long, and review contributions.

	* Studies of the impact of analogy in specific applications and domains, including education, innovation, and law




### Submission

Submissions can fall into one of the following categories : 

1. **Full Research Papers (up to 7 pages plus 2 pages for references)** - Papers with original research work which will be judged on their technical soundness and rigour, though allowances made for novel or experimental directions. We also welcome submissions reporting negative results and sharing experimental insights on the technical challenges and issues of analogical abstraction. 

2. **Short Papers (up to 4 pages)** - Position papers or reports of ongoing work on new research directions.

3. **Dissemination Papers** - Already published papers from top AI venues such as IJCAI, NeurIPS, AAAI, ICML, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP that are relevant to the workshop. Please upload the original submission and abstract to our submission site.


Full and short research papers will be peer-reviewed by at least two reviewers from the PC. Accepted full and short papers will be included in the proceedings of the workshop. 
Dissemination papers will go through short review from the organisers, checking for their quality and relevance to the workshop. Dissemination papers will not be included in the workshop proceedings.

Please submit your contribution via this link: [Submission link](TBD), and select the appropriate paper category (long paper, short paper, dissemination). Submissions should be anonymized and the review will be double-blind. Preprints can be stored on arXiv.



### Invited speakers

We have confirmed two keynote speakers with strong contributions to analogy and abstraction: Ken Forbus and Tony Veale. 

**Ken Forbus** is a Walter P. Murphy Professor of Computer Science and Professor of Education at Northwestern University, with dozens of publications on analogy from a cognitive perspective, and its applications to sketching, moral decision making, and qualitative simulations. 

**Tony Veale** is an associate professor in the School of Computer Science at University College Dublin (UCD) in Ireland. Veale has developed the analogical engine of the hallmark commonsense reasoning project, CYC, and is a leader in the areas of metaphors, computational creativity, and irony.
